Paragraph that describes your app and what it does
If LinkedIn was a mobile-first personal assistant....Our app helps people keep on top of their professional connections by organizing them for you and letting you know who you need to connect with next. We gamify networking with your contacts so you're never missing out on a productive coffee ever again!



Required (core) user stories for your app in a bulleted list
* Import contacts from Address Book
* Search through contacts
* Multi select contacts to add
* Show list of upcoming connections and bombs to show that you haven't met them in a while
* Able to mark that I met with someone

Optional (nice to have) user stories
* Nearby API to suggest connections based on proximity
* Nearby API to realize that you've met someone
* Import from FB/Slack/etc instead of just address book
* Pick out smart suggestions in groups
* Cool multi-select of groups (inspired by Google Photos)
* Person can select next meeting date when 'completes' an item
* Tap to get to a user's contact card
* Select all to complete
* Have different options for how to connect with someone
* Snooze people
